# catTheory
A pedagogical yet powerful library for experimenting with Category‑Theory constructs in Python 3.11 +.  It is written as a *single‑file* package so that it can be dropped straight into a GitHub repository and then split into a proper package layout (``cattheory/__init__.py``, ``cattheory/core.py`` …) when you are ready.
